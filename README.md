Machine Learning in the Kitchen (semester project, EURECOM)

1. Introduction

Cooking recipes provide an interesting yet challenging test-bed for Machine Learning
algorithms. In particular, interesting insights that can be gained from the analyses of
cooking recipes are, e.g., the impact of various combinations of ingredients on dietary
indicators or the rating that users attribute to recipes. Challenges arise due to the variety of
ways in which recipes can be represented in a database and the complexity of
representing sequences of actions involving ingredients and their quantities. Also, the large
number of possible ingredients in a recipe makes the representation large dimensional,
and this generally poses some problems with Machine Learning algorithms.

2. Objectives / Goals

The aim of this project is to create a generative model for recipes, evaluate the
performance of this model and try to produce absolutely new recipes.
